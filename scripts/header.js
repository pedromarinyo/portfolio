aboutContent["monsterPocket"] = "Every iteration of Pokémon begins with our player-character being gifted his/her choice of Pokémon, and from there, utilizing their creature to accrue others; here, like capital begets capital, Pokémon are the essential tool for collecting more Pokémon. <br><br><b>Critiquing Assumptions</b>:<br>The design decisions behind this world are pragmatic. On behalf of players’ comfort, this world-design obfuscates the franchise’s underlying metaphor, that is, one of servitude and transparency that’s especially problematic for minorities in the U.S. The Pokémon-centered world appears precisely crafted for facilitating these teenagers' journeys. The Pokémon world is not so much a world, but a specially built stage for these youngsters’ trial-and-error stumbling toward adulthood. That cataloging the world’s creatures requires their capture, their sequestering away into pokéballs and their continued deployment in battle, all foregrounds these creatures' status as collectables, as signifiers of status and capital. In-game messaging makes clear: These creatures are valued for their utility; they don’t have interior lives worth considering. <br><br><b>Inverting Assumptions</b>:<br>In my reimagining, I attempt to invert the following assumptions by casting players in the role of the Pokemon, a Bulbasaur who's relegated to living inside sparse confines unless called upon to commit violence to his fellow creatures.<br><br>Some specific cases of inversion: Veridian Forest, originally cast as a foreboding \"dungeon\" dangerous to human travelers, is recast as a site of refuge. Likewise, in the original, these creatures lack agency to navigate the world all their own--except for the privileged one selected as a trainer’s favorite who’s allowed to walk outside a pokéball’s confines, following faithfully behind its capturer. In my reimagining, upon escaping, Bulbasaur is free to traverse the world as s/he sees fit. To highlight this newly earned agency, upon reaching Route 1, Bulbasaur now has the ability to interact with his fellow creatures as s/he thinks best, best exemplified by a new choice of \"Soothe\", a non-coercive method of recruiting companions toward a goal that's truly mutual.<br><br>Finally, in the original, Trainers are afforded the opportunity to rename their recent captures. Bulbasaur, however, upon befriending a new creature, learns his/her companion's name, a name that Bulbasaur has no power (nor even attempts) to change, highlighting a revision of Pokémon's original metaphor of ownership. And in order to cement Bulbasaur's equality with those of his companions, the game's final task, i.e., the escape to Veridian forest, requires joint effort and collaboration to dismantle the barrier--effort that Bulbasaur is not excluded from, but rather, must take part in alongside his companions.<br><br><a href='https://pedromarinyo.github.io/monsterPocket/'>Play the game</a>.<br><br><img width='100%' class='projectDetailsImg' src='assets/monsterPocket1.png'><br><br><img width='100%' class='projectDetailsImg' src='assets/monsterPocket2.png'><br><br><img width='100%' class='projectDetailsImg' src='assets/monsterPocket3.png'><br><br><img width='100%' class='projectDetailsImg' src='assets/monsterPocket4.png'>";

Results show that subjects collaboratively constructed solutions that compromised between both positions, while slightly favoring the anti- ban position.

The ability of subjects to defend their assigned character’s position while inhabiting their own perspective, that of an 8th grade student, also hints at this separation. Additionally, results indicated correlations between subjects’ control factors, a subset measure for presence, and total change in prompt agreement.
