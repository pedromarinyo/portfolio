The prototype presented here is targeted at viewers of HBO’s Game of Thrones, a particularly complex storyworld; its design uses manipulable, tightly synchronized spatial visualizations to concretize complex character relationships.

Subjects debated a prompt which proposed a banning cell phones from classrooms. Results show that subjects collaboratively constructed solutions that compromised between both positions, while slightly favoring the anti- ban position. Results also show that subjects experienced gains in character identification after participating in the task regardless of assigned character, hinting at a separation between perceived similarity to characters and affinity for characters’ position. The ability of subjects to defend their assigned character’s position while inhabiting their own perspective, that of an 8th grade student, also hints at this separation. Additionally, results indicated correlations between subjects’ control factors, a subset measure for presence, and total change in prompt agreement. Other positive correlation exist between subject’s reprocessing attempts and task performance, as well as total presence and task performance.<br><br><video width='100%' controls='show' src='assets/mados.mp4' /><br><br><img class='projectDetailsImg' src='assets/mados2.png'>";
